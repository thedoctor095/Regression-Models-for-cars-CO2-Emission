# Regression-Models-for-cars-CO2-Emission

This project deals with a regression problem in which multiple models were trained to predict the amount of CO2 Emissions of cars based on mechanical and consumption features.

EDA was performed and the applied algorithms were LinearRegression, LinearSVR and SVR.
